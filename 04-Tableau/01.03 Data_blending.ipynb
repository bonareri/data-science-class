    "## Data Blending in Tableau\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Blending** is a method used in Tableau to combine data from **multiple data sources** that are **not stored in the same database**. It allows you to analyze related data without needing to perform complex ETL operations or database joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Data Blending?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **way to combine data** from two different data sources **within Tableau**.\n",
    "- Performed **after data is aggregated**, unlike SQL joins (which happen before aggregation).\n",
    "- Works by linking a **primary data source** (main) with one or more **secondary sources** (supplemental).\n",
    "- Useful when:\n",
    "  - Data is stored in **different systems** (e.g., Excel + SQL Server).\n",
    "  - You canâ€™t perform a join before loading into Tableau.\n",
    "  - You need a **loose** relationship between datasets.\n",
    "\n",

    "| Term              | Description                                                                 |\n",
    "|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| **Primary Source**| The main data source (fields appear with a blue checkmark).                 |\n",
    "| **Secondary Source**| The blended data source (fields show orange checkmarks).                |\n",
    "| **Linking Field** | A common field (like `Date`, `Product ID`, or `Region`) used to connect sources. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "**You have:**\n",
    "- Sales data in Excel (primary)\n",
    "- Product details in SQL Server (secondary)\n",
    "\n",
    "**You want to:**\n",
    "- Show sales performance by product category, but product categories are only in the secondary source.\n",
    "\n",
    "â†’ Use **data blending** to connect both datasets via a common field like `Product ID`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Do Data Blending in Tableau\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connect to both data sources** in Tableau.\n",
    "2. Drag a field from the **primary source** to the view.\n",
    "3. Then, drag a field from the **secondary source**.\n",
    "4. Tableau **automatically links** the data if a common field exists (e.g., `Date`, `Product ID`).\n",
    "   - Youâ€™ll see a **chain icon** in the Data pane (linking field).\n",
    "5. Use the **linked field** to control how the data sources blend.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blending Indicator\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary source**: Blue check mark âœ…\n",
    "- **Secondary source**: Orange check mark ðŸŸ§\n",
    "- **Linked field**: Chain link icon ðŸ”— appears in the data pane\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of Data Blending\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blending happens **after aggregation**, which may cause mismatched totals.\n",
    "- Filtering only works well on the **primary source**.\n",
    "- **One-to-many** blends may not show all rows from the secondary source.\n",
    "- Performance can be slower with large datasets.\n",

    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **data blending** when you cannot join data before importing to Tableau.\n",
    "- Ensure linking fields are **clean and matching**.\n",
    "- Be aware of **aggregation mismatches**.\n",
    "- Consider **Data Relationships** (newer alternative in recent Tableau versions).\n",
