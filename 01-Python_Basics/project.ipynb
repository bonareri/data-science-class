    "## ✅ Core Functional Features\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Description | Notes |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|-------|\n",
    "| **Symptom Checker** | Accept symptoms and provide triage categorization (e.g., Emergency, Urgent, Routine) | Use simple decision trees or rule-based logic |\n",
    "| **Age-Specific Recommendations** | Customize triage decisions based on patient age groups (e.g., infant, toddler, child) | Pediatric logic varies by age bracket |\n",
    "| **Vital Signs Input** | Allow input of vitals (temp, pulse, breathing rate, etc.) | Validate ranges for age-appropriate norms |\n",
    "| **Risk Stratification** | Assign risk levels based on combinations of symptoms (e.g., fever + stiff neck = high risk) | Consider color-coded levels (Red, Yellow, Green) |\n",
    "| **First Aid Advice** | Suggest basic actions before seeing a doctor (e.g., hydration, remove clothing in fever) | Can be text-based or image-guided |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Intelligence & Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Description | Notes |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|-------|\n",
    "| **Rule-Based Engine** | Use if/else or decision trees for triage logic | Easy to implement and test |\n",
    "| **Custom Symptom Tree Builder** | Create JSON or YAML symptom trees for modular design | Easier to update without rewriting code |\n",
    "| **Basic ML Integration (optional)** | Use logistic regression or random forest for triage prediction | Only if data is available and learning is desired |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧑‍💻 User Interface Options\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Description | Notes |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|-------|\n",
    "| **Command Line Interface (CLI)** | Basic input/output system | Good for early prototyping |\n",
    "| **GUI Interface** | Use `Tkinter` for form-based inputs and color-coded triage results | Include dropdowns, sliders, and icons |\n",
    "| **Mobile-Friendly GUI (Advanced)** | Consider `Kivy` for touch support | Optional future enhancement |\n",

    "## 🩺 Clinical Workflow Features\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Description | Notes |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|-------|\n",
    "| **Patient Intake Form** | Collect name, age, gender, symptoms, duration, etc. | Store in memory or file |\n",
    "| **Symptom Duration Tracker** | Ask when symptoms started | Important for urgency assessment |\n",
    "| **Repeat Visit Checker** | Warn if patient was triaged recently with same symptoms | Use local file storage for history |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Feedback & Reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Description | Notes |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|-------|\n",
    "| **Triage Summary Report** | Generate summary of input and results | Export as .txt or .pdf |\n",
    "| **Save Consultation Logs** | Store patient sessions for review | Use JSON or SQLite |\n",
    "| **Basic Analytics Dashboard (GUI)** | Show # of high-risk vs low-risk cases, symptom trends | Optional, use matplotlib or `tkinter` canvas |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔔 Extra Enhancements (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Description | Notes |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|-------|\n",
    "| **Twilio SMS Notification** | Send summary or next steps to parent’s phone | Needs API key and internet access |\n",
    "| **Audio Guidance** | Add speech using `pyttsx3` to read results aloud | Improves accessibility |\n",
    "| **Language Toggle** | Support English + Swahili or other local language | Use dictionary-based translation |\n",
    "| **Offline Capabilities** | Ensure app works without internet | Ideal for rural clinics |\n",
