    "Sometimes we want to loop through a <em>set</em> of things such as a list of words, the lines in a file, or a list of numbers. When we have a list of things to loop through, we can construct a <em>definite</em> loop using a <code>for</code> statement. We call the <code>while</code> statement an <em>indefinite</em> loop because it simply loops until some condition becomes <code>False</code>, whereas the <code>for</code> loop is looping through a known set of items so it runs through as many iterations as there are items in the set."
