    "## Using a Personal Access Token (PAT) to Push Code to GitHub via HTTPS\n",
    "If you're having trouble signing in when pushing to GitHub, you can use a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of your password.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token\n",
    "1. Go to Github setting\n",
    "2. Access developer settings\n",
    "3. Go to personal access tokens \n",
    "4. Click on \"Generate new token (classic)\"\n",
    "5. Add a note like: ```My Git Token```\n",
    "6. Set expiration (e.g., 30 days or 90 days)\n",
    "7. Check at least the following scopes:\n",
    "    - ```repo``` (for full access to your repositories)\n",
    "8. Click \"Generate token\"\n",
    "9. Copy the token and store it somewhere safe — you won't see it again!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Clone a Repository Using HTTPS\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Use the Token When Prompted\n",
    "When asked to sign in via terminal:\n",
    "    - Username: your GitHub username\n",
    "    - Password: paste the Personal Access Token (NOT your GitHub password)\n",
    "    \n",
    "```Tip:``` If the token is correct, it will authenticate and start the clone/push/pull operation.\n"

    "### Fix: Python Not Recognized in VS Code \n",
    "#### Step 1: Check if Python is Installed\n",
    "In VS Code, open a terminal and run:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "py --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "If it says ```'python' is not recognized```, proceed to Step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Install Python\n",
    "1. Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",
    "2. Download the latest version for Windows.\n",
    "3. VERY IMPORTANT: On the first install screen, check the box that says:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "☑ Add Python 3.x to PATH\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Click Install Now.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Restart VS Code\n",
    "After installing Python:\n",
    "    - Completely close and reopen VS Code.\n",
    "    - Open a new terminal and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "You should now see the Python version.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Create a Virtual Environment\n",
    "Once Python is recognized, create a virtual environment like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "python -m venv env\n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "py -m venv env\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then activate it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "source env\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Still Not Working?\n",
    "If Python is installed but not recognized, the system PATH variable might not be set. Here’s how to fix it:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Manually Add Python to System PATH\n",
    "1. Press Win + S, search for Environment Variables, and open it.\n",
    "2. Under System Variables, find and select Path, then click Edit.\n",
    "3. Click New, and add the path to your Python installation. Typically:\n",
    "    - C:\\Users\\<your-username>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python3x\\\n",
    "    - and also:\n",
    "    - C:\\Users\\<your-username>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python3x\\Scripts\\\n",
    "4. Click OK to save.\n",
    "5. Restart your computer."
