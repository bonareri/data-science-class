    "# Python Capstone Project Idea Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Title  \n",
    "_What do you want to name your project?_  \n",
    "> Example: Snake Byte, BudgetBuddy, MyWeather, QuizCracker, TaskTamer\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description  \n",
    "_Describe what your project will do._  \n",
    "- What does it help the user do?\n",
    "- Is it a game, tool, or data-based app?\n",
    "- Is it terminal-based or does it have a GUI?\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Example: This project is a weather checker that allows users to enter a city name and receive current weather data. It uses the OpenWeather API and is displayed in the terminal._\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose / Problem Solved  \n",
    "_Why are you building this? What is the goal or benefit of your project?_\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Example: I want to practice using external APIs and conditionals. The app solves the problem of quickly checking the weather without visiting a website._\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Planned Features  \n",
    "_Check all that apply or add your own ideas:_\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] User input (e.g., city name, answer choice, key press)\n",
    "- [ ] Loops and conditionals\n",
    "- [ ] Functions or classes\n",
    "- [ ] File handling (`.txt`, `.csv`, or `.json`)\n",
    "- [ ] Simple GUI (Tkinter or Pygame)\n",
    "- [ ] External API\n",
    "- [ ] Web scraping\n",
    "- [ ] Score or data tracking\n",
    "- [ ] Restart/quit options\n",
    "- [ ] Data visualization (matplotlib, optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technologies / Concepts I Plan to Use  \n",
    "_List Python concepts, libraries, or tools you expect to use._\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example:  \n",
    "> - Python core (functions, loops, dictionaries)  \n",
    "> - requests (for API calls)  \n",
    "> - json module (to parse data)  \n",
    "> - Tkinter (for GUI)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source (if any)  \n",
    "_If your project uses external data, where is it coming from?_\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] API (e.g., OpenWeather, PokéAPI, NewsAPI)\n",
    "- [ ] Web scraping (e.g., quotes or news)\n",
    "- [ ] Local file (manually created `.csv` or `.json`)\n",
    "- [ ] No data needed\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Criteria  \n",
    "_How will you know your project is complete? What’s the minimum version you must complete?_\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: The app will take a city name, return the weather, and show temperature and description. I’ll consider it complete when it handles errors and works with at least 5 cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stretch Goals \n",
    "_What features would you add if you had extra time?_\n",
    "\n",
    "> - GUI version with Tkinter  \n",
    "> - Store search history in a file  \n",
    "> - Add weather icons\n",
