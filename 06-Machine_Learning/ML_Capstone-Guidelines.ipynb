    "## Capstone Machine Learning Project Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Project Selection\n",
    "- Choose a **problem statement** that is meaningful and solvable with available data. Examples:\n",
    "- Ensure the project:\n",
    "  - Has a **clear goal** (classification or regression)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Problem Definition\n",
    "Clearly state:\n",
    "- **What is the problem?**\n",
    "- **Why is it important?**\n",
    "- **Who benefits from solving it?**\n",
    "- **What type of ML task is it?** (classification or regression)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Collection & Understanding\n",
    "- Source your dataset \n",
    "- Explore the dataset:\n",
    "  - Data types (numerical, categorical)\n",
    "  - Missing values\n",
    "  - Outliers\n",
    "  - Basic statistics\n",
    "- Present **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** with visualizations (histograms, bar charts, correlations).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "- Handle missing values\n",
    "- Encode categorical variables\n",
    "- Normalize/standardize numerical features\n",
    "- Handle imbalanced data (e.g., oversampling/undersampling if applicable)\n",
    "- Split into **train and test sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Modeling\n",
    "- Start with at least **two baseline models** (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).\n",
    "- Compare performance of different models.\n",
    "- Perform **hyperparameter tuning** using **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV**.\n",
    "- Document why you chose a particular model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Evaluation\n",
    "- Use appropriate metrics:\n",
    "  - **Classification** → Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score\n",
    "  - **Regression** → RMSE, MAE, R²\n",
    "- Show results with:\n",
    "  - Confusion matrix (for classification)\n",
    "  - Feature importance (for tree-based models)\n",
    "  - **Validation Curves** → analyze how model performance changes with hyperparameters\n",
    "  - **Learning Curves** → analyze if the model suffers from high bias (underfitting) or high variance (overfitting)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Error Analysis\n",
    "- Look at the **types of errors** your model is making:\n",
    "  - Which classes are most misclassified? (confusion matrix analysis)\n",
    "  - Are errors higher in certain groups of data? (e.g., small houses vs large houses, new vs old customers)\n",
    "  - Does the model underperform on rare cases?\n",
    "- Discuss **possible reasons** for errors:\n",
    "  - Lack of enough data\n",
    "  - Noisy or poor-quality features\n",
    "  - Model limitations\n",
    "- Suggest **ways to improve**:\n",
    "  - Collect more data\n",
    "  - Engineer better features\n",
    "  - Try different models or tuning strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Model Interpretation\n",
    "- Discuss which features are most important in making predictions.\n",
    "- Explain the results in simple terms (e.g., “customers with low income are more likely to churn”).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Deployment\n",
    "- Deploy the model using **Streamlit** for a simple user interface.\n",
    "- Alternatively, prepare a well-documented Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how the model works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Project Report Structure\n",
    "Your report/notebook should include:\n",
    "1. **Title & Abstract**  \n",
    "2. **Problem Statement**  \n",
    "3. **Data Collection & Understanding**  \n",
    "4. **Data Preprocessing**  \n",
    "5. **Modeling Approach**  \n",
    "6. **Results & Evaluation**  \n",
    "7. **Error Analysis**\n",
    "8. **Conclusion & Future Work**  "
