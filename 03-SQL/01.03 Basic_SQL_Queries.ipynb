    "## Basic SQL Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to **communicate with relational databases**. Below are the most common SQL statements every beginner should know.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. SELECT – Retrieve Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, age FROM Employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. WHERE – Filter Records\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column1 FROM table_name WHERE condition;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name FROM Employees WHERE department = 'HR';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. ORDER BY – Sort Results\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column [ASC|DESC];\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT name, salary FROM Employees ORDER BY salary DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX – Aggregate Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees;\n",
    "SELECT SUM(salary) FROM Employees;\n",
    "SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employees;\n",
    "SELECT MIN(salary) FROM Employees;\n",
    "SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. GROUP BY – Group Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM Employees GROUP BY department;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. HAVING – Filter Grouped Data\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT department, AVG(salary)\n",
    "FROM Employees\n",
    "GROUP BY department\n",
    "HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. UPDATE – Modify Existing Data\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "UPDATE table_name\n",
    "SET column1 = value1\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. DELETE – Remove Records\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`Tips`\n",
    "- SQL keywords are not case-sensitive, but uppercase is preferred by convention.\n",
    "- Always use WHERE when updating or deleting to avoid affecting all records."
