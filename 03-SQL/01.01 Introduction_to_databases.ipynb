    "## Introduction\n",
    "- Data refers to raw facts, figures, or symbols that represent information in a form suitable for processing, analysis, or communication. \n",
    "- It can be qualitative (descriptive) or quantitative (numeric), and it has no meaning until it is interpreted or processed.\n",
    "- Data is central to how many of today’s applications and websites function. \n",
    "- Comments on a viral video, changing scores in a multiplayer game, and the items you left in a shopping cart on your favorite online store are all bits of information stored somewhere in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Types of Data\n",
    "1. Structured Data\n",
    "    - Organized and stored in a fixed format (e.g., tables in databases).\n",
    "    - Example: Spreadsheets, SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unstructured Data\n",
    "    - Lacks a pre-defined format or structure.\n",
    "    - Example: Emails, videos, social media posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Semi-Structured Data\n",
    "    - Partially organized with tags or markers.\n",
    "    - Example: JSON, XML files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Relational Database is a structured collection of data that stores information in tables(also called `relations`). \n",
    "- Each table has rows(`tuples`) and columns(`attributes`), and these tables can be related to each other using keys (primary and foreign keys).\n",
    "- It is based on Relational Model Theory, proposed by E. F. Codd in 1970.\n",
    "- The relational model’s structural elements help to keep data stored in an organized way, but storing data is only useful if you can retrieve it. \n",
    "- To retrieve information from an RDBMS, you can issue a `query`, or a structured request for a set of information. - Most relational databases use a language called `Structured Query Language` \n",

    "| **Table (Relation)**   | A collection of data about a particular subject. Each table represents a real-world entity. |\n",
    "| **Row (Tuple/Record)** | A single, uniquely identifiable item in a table. Each row is a record.                      |\n",
    "| **Column (Attribute)** | A single field in a table; defines the type of data stored (e.g., name, date).              |\n",

    "### Data Integrity Using Constraints\n",
    "Relational databases maintain data integrity using constraints:\n",

    "- Data integrity and consistency through constraints.\n",
    "- Easy to query using SQL (Structured Query Language).\n",

    "- Clear data relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of Relational Databases\n",
    "- Complexity with Large or Unstructured Data\n",
    "- Scalability Limitations (Vertical Scaling) - you need a more powerful server (CPU, RAM, etc.) rather than simply adding more machines.\n",
    "- Schema Rigidity - structure (tables, columns, data types) must be defined before inserting data."

    "### Non-relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "- A non-relational database is a database that does not use the traditional table-based relational model.\n",
    "- Instead, it uses different formats like:\n",
    "    - Documents\n",
    "    - Key-Value pairs\n",
    "    - Graphs\n",
    "    - Wide-columns\n",
    "- These databases are designed for flexibility, scalability, and handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Non-Relational Databases\n",
    "#### 1. Document Stores\n",
    "- Store data as documents (usually JSON or BSON).\n",
    "- Documents can contain nested structures.\n",
    "- Schema-less: Each document can have a different structure.\n",
    "    - Example: MongoDB, CouchDB\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"_id\": \"001\",\n",
    "  \"name\": \"Alice\",\n",
    "  \"email\": \"alice@mail.com\",\n",
    "  \"orders\": [\n",
    "    {\"id\": 1, \"product\": \"Book\", \"price\": 20},\n",
    "    {\"id\": 2, \"product\": \"Pen\", \"price\": 5}\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Key-Value Stores\n",
    "- The simplest NoSQL model.\n",
    "- Data is stored as a key → value pair.\n",
    "- Fast and highly scalable.\n",
    "    - Example: Redis, DynamoDB, Riak\n",
    "```css\n",
    "\"user:001\" → \"{name: 'Alice', age: 25}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Column-Oriented Stores (Wide-Column)\n",
    "- Data is stored in columns rather than rows.\n",
    "- Good for high-performance analytical queries.\n",
    "    - Example: Apache Cassandra, HBase\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "UserTable\n",
    "| user_id | name   | email         | age |\n",
    "|---------|--------|---------------|-----|\n",
    "| 1       | Alice  | alice@mail.com| 25  |\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each row can have different columns (schema flexible).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Graph Databases\n",
    "- Use nodes (entities) and edges (relationships).\n",
    "- Ideal for complex relationships between data.\n",
    "    - Example: Neo4j, ArangoDB\n",
    "- Used in: social networks, fraud detection, knowledge graphs.\n",

    "\n",
    "- A **Primary Key** uniquely identifies each record in a table.\n",
    "- It **cannot be NULL** and must be **unique**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "In the EMPLOYEE table, `ID` can be the primary key since it is unique for each employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Candidate Keys\n",
    "- These are columns that can potentially serve as primary keys.\n",
    "- All candidate keys are unique and non-null.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "In the EMPLOYEE table, we can also select License_Number or Passport_Number as candidate keys since they are also unique for each employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Alternate Key\n",
    "- When a candidate key is not chosen as the primary key, it becomes an alternate key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "If we choose ID as the primary key, then Passport_Number and License_Number become alternate keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Composite Key\n",
    "- A composite key uses more than one column to uniquely identify a row.\n",
    "- Useful when no single column can serve as a unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "If the table doesn't have a unique ID, we might use License_Number + Passport_Number together as a composite primary key.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "PRIMARY KEY (License_Number, Passport_Number)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Foreign Key\n",
    "- A foreign key is used to link two tables.\n",
    "- It refers to the primary key in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Assume we have another table Payroll, with a column Employee_ID that references the EMPLOYEE.ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Super Key\n",
    "- A super key is any combination of columns that uniquely identifies a row.\n",
    "- All candidate keys are super keys, but super keys can contain extra attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    " In the above EMPLOYEE table, for(EMPLOEE_ID, EMPLOYEE_NAME), the name of two employees can be the same, but their EMPLYEE_ID can’t be the same. Hence, this combination can also be a key.\n"
