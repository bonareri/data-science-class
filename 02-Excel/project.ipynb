    "Farmers don’t just want to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "“My nitrogen is low.”\n",
    "\n",
    "They want to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "“What fertilizer should I apply, how much, and when?”\n",
    "\n",
    "You're not just predicting — you're prescribing solutions. That’s powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. It Completes the Feedback Loop\n",
    "- Analysis (nitrogen forecasting)\n",
    "to\n",
    "- Action (recommendation of fertilizers)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Applies AI + Logic + Domain Knowledge\n",
    "The recommender engine can combine:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicted soil nutrient levels (from the model)\n",
    "- Crop type (e.g., maize vs. beans)\n",
    "- Soil texture & pH\n",
    "- Farming best practices (agronomy)\n",
    "- Local fertilizer options (e.g., Urea, DAP)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What will the Fertilizer Recommender Do?\n",
    "inputs\n",
    "- Soil nitrogen level (from the model)\n",
    "- Crop type (e.g., maize, beans, sorghum)\n",
    "- Soil pH, texture\n",
    "- Area size (in acres or hectares)\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "- Recommended fertilizer: e.g., \"Apply 100 kg/ha of Urea (46% N)\"\n",
    "- Timing: e.g., \"Split across 2 applications: planting + 4 weeks after\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features to Add\n",
    "- Savings calculator – show cost benefit of optimized fertilizer use\n",
    "- Map overlay – visualize recommendation zones\n",
    "- PDF report generator – deliver customized fertilizer plans\n",
    "- SMS API – send fertilizer advice to farmers without smartphones\n",
    "\n",
    "### How this will work\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recommender systems are algorithms providing personalized suggestions for items that are most relevant to each user. \n",
    "- These systems leverage various techniques, including collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, to make personalized recommendations. \n",
