    "## Introduction to Tableau\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tableau** is a powerful data visualization tool used to convert raw data into understandable dashboards and visual reports. It helps users see and understand their data using a drag-and-drop interface for fast analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Tableau?\n",
    "- Easy to use (drag-and-drop)\n",
    "- Connects to various data sources\n",
    "- Builds interactive dashboards\n",
    "- Supports real-time data updates\n",
    "- Ideal for business intelligence and storytelling\n",

    "## Dimensions and Measures in Tableau\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Dimensions\n",
    "- **Definition**: Categorical fields that describe and segment data. They are qualitative and usually *non-numeric*.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Used to break data into groups (e.g., by Region, Product, Date).\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - Product Name\n",
    "  - Region\n",
    "  - Order Date\n",
    "  - Customer ID\n",
    "  - Category\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- Define the **level of detail** or **granularity** in a view.\n",
    "- Appear as **blue pills** in Tableau by default.\n",
    "- Typically **discrete** (distinct categories).\n",
    "- Placed in rows, columns, filters, color, labels, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Measures\n",
    "- **Definition**: Numeric fields used for calculation and analysis. They are quantitative and *can be aggregated*.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Provide values to be measured (e.g., total sales, average profit).\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - Sales\n",
    "  - Profit\n",
    "  - Quantity\n",
    "  - Discount\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- Can be aggregated (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.)\n",
    "- Appear as **green pills** in Tableau by default.\n",
    "- Typically **continuous** (range of numeric values).\n",
    "- Used on axes, tooltips, size, and color shelves.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dimensions vs Measures: Tableau Classification\n",
    "Tableau automatically classifies fields based on their **data type**:\n",
    "- **Strings** (text) → Dimension\n",
    "- **Dates** → Dimension (but can be continuous or discrete)\n",
    "- **Numbers** → Measure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convert Between Them\n",
    "- Right-click a field > Select **\"Convert to Dimension\"** or **\"Convert to Measure\"**\n",
    "- Useful for treating numeric IDs as labels, or categorizing numeric values\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discrete vs Continuous Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete\n",
    "- Represent **distinct, separate values**\n",
    "- Appear as **blue pills**\n",
    "- Create **headers** in views\n",
    "- Used for categorization and grouping\n",
    "- Applies to both **dimensions** and **measures**\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Examples**:\n",
    "  - Country\n",
    "  - Customer Segment\n",
    "  - Order ID\n",
    "  - Discrete Month (Jan, Feb...)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Continuous\n",
    "- Represent a **range of values**\n",
    "- Appear as **green pills**\n",
    "- Create **axes** in views\n",
    "- Used for trends, averages, and ranges\n",
    "- Usually applied to **measures**\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Examples**:\n",
    "  - Sales\n",
    "  - Profit\n",
    "  - Continuous Date (timeline)\n",
    "  - Age\n",

    "### Quick Tips\n",
    "- Start with **dimensions** to define your structure.\n",
    "- Add **measures** to analyze your data.\n",
    "- Use **discrete** fields for categories and filters.\n",
    "- Use **continuous** fields for trends and numeric analysis.\n",
