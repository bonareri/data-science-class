    "### What is Manifold Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Manifold learning` is a type of nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique.\n",
    "- It is based on the idea that high-dimensional data often lies on a lower-dimensional \"manifold\" (a smooth, curved surface) inside that high-dimensional space."

    "- Imagine a piece of paper (2D surface).\n",
    "- You can roll it into a tube or twist it into a Swiss roll shape.\n",
    "- Even though the paper now exists in 3D space, all the points on it still lie on a 2D manifold (the paper surface).\n",

    "- t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) – great for visualizing clusters in 2D/3D.\n",
    "- UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) – preserves both local and global structure, often better than t-SNE for speed and scalability."
