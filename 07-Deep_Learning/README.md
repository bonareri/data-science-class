# Deep Learning

This module explores advanced machine learning using deep neural networks with libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Students will learn to build, train, and evaluate deep learning models for various tasks.

## Topics:
- Introduction to Neural Networks
- Forward and Backward Propagation
- Activation Functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, etc.)
- Training and Optimization (Gradient Descent, Adam)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification
- Autoencoders for feature extraction and anomaly detection
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTM for Time Series Forecasting
